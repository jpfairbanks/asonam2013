# Case Study using STINGER for social media analysis
In this case study we use Twitter data collected around the impact of hurricane sandy to show how social media can be analyzed using the STINGER graph library.

## Description of DATA collected
## Algorithms used
## Data Analysis
Measuring the change in permutations can be done with 

Generalized Kendall's Tau
This seems to be the most useful
$\sum_{i<j} p_i p_j [\sigma(i) > \sigma(j)]$
Total number of inversions with positional weights.
James thinks that the positional weights should be exponentially decaying from the top. That way we can ignore the differences at the bottom which will be mostly noise.

## Colaboration with CJ Hutto
## Conclusions
